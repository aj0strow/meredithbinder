	The Importance of Accepting Blame

<span class="subtitle">
	A Lesson From Improvisational Theater
</span>
<br /><br />
<p>
	My R&amp;D team, part of a multinational engineering corporation, was developing a new product with an 
	eminent release date. The Accounting Department warned us that the balance sheet would show a million 
	dollar loss for each day the release was delayed. We were three months behind schedule. 
</p>
<p>
	As the pressure at work built, I decided to treat myself to improvisational acting class. The first night 
	of class our teacher taught us the definition of acting: “Living truthfully under imaginary circumstances.” 
	I mulled over my day and wondered how many of us live truthfully under real circumstances—especially in our 
	professional lives.
</p>
<p>
	The class focused on improvised scenes designed to teach actors how to affectively listen and respond to 
	each other. Our teacher explained the rules for improvisation.
</p>

<h4>Rules for Improvisation</h4>
<ol>
	<li>
		Respond to your scene partners with “Yes”
	</li>
	<li>
		Make everyone else look good
	</li>
	<li>
		Be changed by what is said and what happens
	</li>
	<li>
		Co-create a shared agenda
	</li>
	<li>
		Mistakes are invitations
	</li>
	<li>
		Keep the energy going
	</li>
	<li>
		Serve the good of the whole cast
	</li>
</ol>
<p>
	All of these rules are designed to keep the story moving forward. If one actor suggests, “Let’s dance on 
	the moon!” the actors must respond “Yes, and then….” If they respond “No.”, the story grinds to a halt. 
	Abiding by these rules allows actor to create a shared agenda. 
</p>
<p>
	It is important to accept all ideas. If an actor makes a factual error it should be seen as an opportunity to create 
	something new. If one actor says, “Let’s go to China to see the Dead Sea Scrolls.” The rest of the cast creates a 
	story that assumes the Dead Sea Scrolls are in China. These moment-to-moment transitions make scenes exciting.
</p>
<p>
	If one actor fails, the scene fails and therefore all of the actors fail. To succeed actors must listen to and affect 
	each other. I quickly learned the power of these rules. When my classmates and I followed the rules, we captivated our 
	audience. If one actor tried to control the scene or stonewall an idea, the scene failed.
</p>
<p>
	Our teacher also taught us to that if a scene is not working we should stop and admit failure. He showed us what he 
	called a “failure bow”—actors raise their hands over their heads and call out “Thank you!” He explained that an audience 
	applauds after a failure bow because it admires the risk the actors take in admitting failure.

	A few days later I attended the V.P. of Engineering’s weekly status meeting. I was one of twenty managers and lead engineers 
	in attendance. The language used in these meetings increasingly reflected the stressful environment.  It was becoming more 
	and more common for us to speak about problems in the passive voice, e.g., “Mistakes were made.” People also muttered under 
	their breath about “career limiting moves” and how to “stay off the critical path.” I began to wonder if deflecting blame 
	had become more important than moving the project forward.
</p>
<p>
	That morning, when the V.P. announced, “A calculation error was made causing further schedule delays,” I decided to try out 
	my new improvisation techniques in a real world situation. I threw my arms in the air and announced, “That was us!” My coworkers 
	stared open mouthed and I smiled victoriously back at them. 
</p>
<p>
	It just so happened that the next item on the V.P.’s list was also an issue for my department. I threw my arms in the air again. 
	“Oh yeah. That too! That was us!” 
</p>
<p>
	A shocked coworker asked me “Are you going to take the blame for everything?”
</p>
<p>
	“Nope.” I answer. “Just our fair share.”
</p>
<p>
	The atmosphere of the meeting changed considerably. Other people stepped up and admitted to having problems. I wildly applauded 
	their courage to admit failure. As each problem came out into the open, we worked together to plan how to recover. It was the 
	most productive and most relaxed meeting we’d had in a long time.
</p>
<p>
	Later that morning I was walking down a corridor when an engineer ran toward me frantically waving her arms over her head. 
	“Meredith! I broke the software build!” 
</p>
<p>
	“Alright! Way to go!” I cheered and we both laughed. 
</p>
<p>
	“That felt good!” she declared. We headed back to her laboratory and made a plan to get the software build running by the 
	end of the day.
</p>
<p>
	After lunch I returned to my office and found a sticky note taped to my computer. Another engineer had drawn a stick figure 
	holding its hands above its head. Under the figure he had written: “I blew it! Come see me ASAP!” 
</p>
<p>
	At the end of the day I marveled at the power of admitting failure in the workplace. After just one day we were:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		Responding to our coworkers with “Yes”
	</li>
	<li>
		Making everyone else on the team look good
	</li>
	<li>
		Changing our views by what was said and what happened
	</li>
	<li>
		Co-creating a shared agenda
	</li>
	<li>
		Accepting mistakes as invitations to become part of the solution
	</li>
	<li>
		Keeping our energy going
	</li>
	<li>
		Serving the good of the whole team
	</li>
</ol>

<p>
	Although doing a failure bow in the middle of a meeting was not necessary to achieve these accomplishments, it added an element 
	of fun. A team’s ability to laugh at themselves and their situation is invaluable.
