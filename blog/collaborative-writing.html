	Getting Engineers’ Input Through Art
</span>
<br /><br />
<p>
	I had just begun a new program management job for an online advertisement company. My job encompassed identifying, 
	prioritizing, and managing backend software development. There was only one problem—there was no documentation for 
	the backend. To further complicate matters, most of the engineers who had built the backend no longer worked for 
	the company. Even though the original backend was still used to serve advertisements, the current team claimed to 
	have no knowledge of its architecture.
</p>
<p>
	Left to my own devices, I read through the source code and diagramed the backend architecture as best I could. I 
	then attempted to set up meetings with the engineers who maintained the backend. Unfortunately the engineers, none 
	of whom had designed the software, were not familiar with the over-all architecture and were therefore reluctant 
	to answer my questions. 
</p>
<p>
	After my first week in my new job I went home befuddled. I could not perform any of my job responsibilities until 
	I could get an accurate description of the backend functionality. 
</p>
<p>
	That weekend I joined my neighbors in painting a mural to decorate an arterial underpass. It was our job to paint 
	within the lines of an artist’s drawing. We were hesitant at first. What if we made a mistake? What if we painted 
	out side the lines? The neighborhood coordinator assured us that the artist would come back after we finished our 
	part of the painting and clean up our work to ensure the mural was accurate. Only then did we grab our brushes. 
	We painted, socialized, and enjoyed ice cream donated by a local business. Creating something to benefit the community 
	together in a stress-free environment was insightful. How could I get my team to come together, discard their inhibitions, 
	and write the backend documentation?
</p>
<p>
	The following Monday, inspired by my experience painting the mural, I took a large piece of paper and drew a diagram my understanding of the backend 
	architecture. I tacked the paper on a wall across from my office cubical. On a table next 
	to the diagram I provided colored pens and Post-It notes. To entice visitors I also put out some food and a bucket of ice filled with 
	soft drinks. Throughout the day, people congregated by the diagram as they enjoyed the refreshments. I held 
	my breath as I listened to their conversations. 
</p>
<p>
	“What is she doing? Art or something?”
</p>
<p>
	“Says here it’s the backend architecture.”
</p>
<p>
	“She got this part wrong or sure!” 
</p>
<p>
	I continued to hold my breath until I heard the rustle of pens and papers. Once the road was clear I took a look. Sure 
	enough, there were sticky notes with drawings, arrows, explanations, and a few jokes thrown in for good measure. Yes! 
	They were reviewing and correcting my diagram!

<p>
	Every evening I updated my drawing and reposted. I stocked coffee and pastries in the morning and soft drinks and snacks 
	in the afternoon. People dropped by throughout the day to see how the diagram was progressing. The entire team felt 
	ownership of both the document and my success in creating usable backend documentation. 
</p>
<p>
	I believe the casual atmosphere and collaborative nature of my “community art project” put the engineers at ease. They 
	no longer worried if they had the best or most accurate answers. If there was a mistake, there were enough eyes on the 
	diagram (and later the full document) to ensure accuracy.
