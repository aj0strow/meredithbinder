					<h3>About me</h3>
	
					<p>
						I am a technical writer, engineer, and program manager.  I love 
						technology and I love to write, teach, and design documents. I 
						have expertise in writing the following documents:
					</p>
					<ul class="swirl">
						<li>Engineering specifications</li>
						<li>Business plans</li>
						<li>User manuals</li>
						<li>White papers</li>
						<li>Help documentation</li>
						<li>Persuasive writing</li>
						<li>User instructions</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						After a ten-year career in technical program management, I made 
						a decision to focus on technical writing and I earned a Certificate 
						in Technical Writing and Editing at the University of Washington. 
						The program allowed me to hone my writing skills and get feedback 
						from professionals. In addition to writing, I also studied document 
						design, human-centered design, and usability.
					</p>
					<p>
						In addition to my professional interests, I enjoy the arts. Iâ€™ve tried 
						my hand at film acting, stage and screen writing, theater, and visual art. 
						I often draw on my artistic experiences in my work as a technical writer 
						and program manager. I have written about my experiences of using improvisational 
						theater techniques in program management in the blog.
					</p>
					<p>
						Thank you for visiting my site. Please take some time to review my 
						resume and writing samples.
